		<div class="slide active"><h1>RESEARCH</h1><br><br>Talk with potential buyers/market managers and find out if and when they have a need for the crop you are considering growing and if not, what produce they may be looking for and in what quantity, over what period of time.
</div>
		<div class="slide"><h1>AGREEMENTS</h1><br><br>You should have an agreement with a buyer before you plant the crop. You donâ€™t want to learn at harvest time that the market you had in mind already had 5 vendors for that same item and has no interest in sourcing from you.</div>
		<div class="slide"><h1>ROLL-OUT STRATEGY</h1><br><br>If you are introducing a new item to a market, work on developing a roll-out strategy with your buyer, offering promotions and samples to help introduce your product to customers. Start small and establish communication with buyers early.</div>
