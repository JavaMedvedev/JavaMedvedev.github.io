              If your Blackboard course has folders inside folders, each of them will appear in Canvas as a separate module of a Canvas course. You might consider moving content from subfolders to their master folders before transferring. In that case, each of your master forlders will correspond to a module in Canvas after migration. In Canvas, you will be able to easily rearrange content.

You can log-in to Canvas at <a href="https://universityofgalway.instructure.com" target="_blank">https://universityofgalway.instructure.com</a> using your Office 365 university credentials. Staff members log in to Canvas using their staff ID followed by @nuigalway.ie (e.g. 0123456s@nuigalway.ie) and Campus Account password (Note: login details haven't been updated to the @universityofgalway.ie standard yet).  You will also be prompted for your Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) SMS/Authenticator App code.

      If you were/are running a course in the 22/23 academic year, its 23/24 shell has been created in Canvas and you must have access to it right now. These are the actual courses that students will have access to in September. You can start populating them with content.<br><br>
	  If you will teach a new course in 23/24 or the course wasn't taught in the 22/23 academic year, it will be created for you during the regular rollover time of late June or July. If you taught a course in 21/22 but not in 22/23 - make sure you copied content from 21/22 to 22/23 in Blackboard so that you don't lose it as only the 22/23 Balckboard courses will be transferred to Canvas.<br><br>
	  In April/May, ISS will create copies of 22/23 courses in Canvas and migrate data from 22/23 Blackboard courses into them.<br><br>
	  <b>NOTE:</b> During the rollover, the content will come into 22/23 courses so won't affect 23/24 shells at all or anything done in there. You can freely work on your next year courses in Canvas right now.
