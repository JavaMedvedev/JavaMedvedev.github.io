            <h3>Primary victims</h3>
            <p><br>Primary victims include those actually in danger, those who perceive themselves to be in danger, and rescuers. Such a person will succeed so long as they could show that psychiatric injury was foreseeable to a person of reasonable fortitude.The principle of the ‘egg-skull rule’ also applies, with the standard requirement that some damage of ‘that type’ be foreseeable. However, see Keane CJ in Fletcher v Commissioners for Public Works [2003] 2 ILRM cited above.</p>

            <h3>Secondary victims</h3>
            <p>These are ‘non-participants’, those who believe themselves to be in no personal danger. These would be for instance those who witness the event, or hear about it either at the time or later. In order to succeed in a claim they must prove more than mere foreseeability. <b>They must show: 1.</b> a close tie of love and affection with the immediate victim, McFarlane v EE Caledonia Ltd [1994] 2 All ER 1, <b>2.</b>  proximity in time and space to the accident or its immediate aftermath, <b>3.</b>  perception of the accident or its aftermath by sight or hearing.</p>
