When arriving at the scene her car was hit with some debris from the accident. The car involved a Bus Éireann bus and a single occupant car. Ms Sheehan witnessed the decapitated body of the occupant of that car in the back seat, whom she mistakenly at first thought was a child. She also witnessed the bloodied face of the bus driver. She called the emergency services and searched the area for any other injured parties. The effect of the accident on Ms Sheehan was profound. She was diagnosed with PTSD, had significant anxiety about the danger of living in the countryside.<br><br><img src = "https://JavaMedvedev.github.io/nervous_shock/tables/car.png" width = 100%>
