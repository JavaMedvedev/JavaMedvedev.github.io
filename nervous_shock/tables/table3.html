They got through without physical injury but Mrs Coultas fainted and suffered what was described as mental shock.

      <td style="width: 72%">Despite the negligence of the railway guard no liability was imposed as it was stated that the injury was unforeseeable. As stated in that case: Damages arising from mere sudden terror unaccompanied by any actual physical injury, but occasioning a nervous or mental shock, cannot under such circumstances, their Lordships think, be considered a consequence which, in the ordinary course of things, would flow from the negligence of the gate-keeper.
