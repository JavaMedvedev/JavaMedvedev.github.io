      <td style="width: 75%"><b><i>White v Chief Constable of the South Yorkshire Police [1999] 2 AC 455</i></b><br>Police officers involved in the rescue operation following Hillsborough sought to recover for damage sustained. Lord Hoffman stated that a ‘rescuer plaintiff’ could only be regarded as a primary victim where they had ‘objectively exposed (themselves) to (physical danger) or reasonably believed that (they) were doing so.’ As part of Lord Hoffman’s reasoning, he opined that to allow rescuers who had not been subject to injury to recover, would be to open the floodgates to people who would join as rescuers in order to seek compensation.
