      <td style="width: 75%"><b><i>Byrne v Southern and Western Ry Co Court of Appeal, February 1884:</i></b><br>The plaintiff was a superintendent of the telegraph office at Limerick Junction. His office consisted of a small building at one end of the railway. At one point, due to the negligence of another worker, a train broke down the wall of the office. Although the superintendent was not hurt, he himself claimed that ‘a hair on his head was not touched’, he did get a great fright and a shock. He heard shouts of the clerks and believed that the office was all going to collapse.
